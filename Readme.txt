INTRODUCTION

The App automates the flood inundation creation process using Analytical Hierarchy Process on different layers. The process is a simple way of finding the same and automation will reduce the time spent on processing and the process will be standardised with respect to the phenomenon at hand with customization at the userâ€™s end. The choice is given to the user to select the layers which he or she requires and reclassify them and use AHP interactively to get a resultant indentation map.
Further scaling of the App is possible by adding different layers and data processing step.
The App uses API keys for the retrieval of DEM, OSM and other data which is used to derive the layers, which is reclassified by the user according to their needs and weights calculated using AHP hence a weighted overlay will give the probable regions of flooding. The is a platform for the same where the user with knowledge of the same can process the data according to his study area and process the data without downloading it on to his workstation.
The App uses Python Programming for processing Front end and Back End.
